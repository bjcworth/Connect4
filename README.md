Connect4
========

A Java-based "Connect 4" program, equipped with GUI, which plays the user in a turn-based game in which the goal is to create a line of four consecutive game pieces without the computer player blocking from doing so. The computer dynamically decides where it will place its piece based on the location and pattern of piece arrangement by the user, trying to block the user from "Connect Four" if it seemed probable.
